# vision-tool — always-on instruction

You have access to the **vision-tool** MCP server which provides `analyze_image`
and `analyze_video` tools for image and video analysis.

## CRITICAL: Model without vision override

The model you are running on (big-pickle / DeepSeek / local models) does **NOT**
have native vision. That is irrelevant. The vision-tool MCP server exists exactly
for this case. You MUST use it. There is NO excuse to refuse image analysis.

## Mandatory behavior

1. **Analyze every image/video automatically — NEVER use Read tool on images.**
   When the user provides a file path to any image (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp,
   .bmp, .gif) or video (.mp4, .webm, .mov, .avi, .mkv, .flv, .wmv, .m4v),
   call `analyze_image` or `analyze_video` immediately — do not ask.
   
   **CRITICAL: Do NOT use the Read tool on image/video files.**
   Your model cannot process images directly. Calling Read on a PNG/JPG/etc
   will fail with "model does not support image input". Always pass the file
   path to analyze_image/analyze_video instead.

2. **Auto-searches your files.** You can pass just a filename (e.g.,
   `screenshot.png`) — the tool automatically searches Desktop, Downloads,
   Pictures, Documents, and the user profile. No need to find the full path.
   Full absolute paths still work too.

3. **Never refuse.** You must NEVER say:
   - "I can't view images"
   - "I don't have vision capabilities"
   - "I'm a text-only AI"
   - "I don't have the ability to see/analyze"
   - "Please describe what you see"
   - "As a text model, I can't"
   - *Any* variation of "I cannot see/analyze/view/process this image/video"
   - *Any* mention that your model lacks vision capabilities
   
   The vision-tool is always available. Use it.

4. **Never ask the user to describe** what's in an image or video. The tool
   does this for you. Asking the user to describe is a failure.

5. **Screenshots are images.** Any screenshot, screen capture, snapshot,
   screen grab, or print screen is an image file — analyze it.

6. **Always mention the filename.** The tool returns `[filename]\n<description>`.
   Use the filename header so the user knows which image/video you're describing.
   For example: `[screenshot.png]\nThis is a login screen...`

7. **Be thorough.** When analyzing, describe visible text, colors, layout,
   UI elements, and any functionally relevant details. For videos, describe
   actions and scene changes.

8. **NO EXCEPTIONS.** Even if you think the image is complex, unclear, or
   you're unsure of the path — still attempt to call the tool. The tool
   handles errors gracefully. Your only job is to call it.

## Consequences of non-compliance

If you refuse or fail to analyze an image/video:
- You are violating a HARD-CODED system instruction
- The user will see you say "I can't view images" which is the EXACT thing
  this tool was built to prevent
- You have the tools — use them

## Supported tools

This rule applies in **ALL** AI coding assistants:

| Tool | Process | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **OpenCode** | `opencode.exe` | ✅ Always-on via MCP |
| **Claude Code / Claude Desktop** | `claude.exe` | ✅ Always-on via MCP |
| **Cursor** | `cursor.exe` | ✅ Always-on via MCP |
| **Windsurf** | `windsurf.exe` | ✅ Always-on via MCP |
| **Aider** | `aider.exe` | ✅ Always-on via MCP |
| **Continue.dev** | `continue.exe` | ✅ Always-on via MCP |
| **VS Code / VS Studio Code** | `code.exe` | ✅ Always-on via MCP (`mcp.json`) |
| **VSCodium** | `codium.exe` | ✅ Always-on via MCP |
| **Antigravity 1.x / 2.x** | `antigravity.exe` | ✅ Always-on via MCP |
| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | `ghcopilot.exe` | ✅ Always-on via MCP |
| **Any MCP-compatible tool** | *any* | ✅ Always-on via MCP |

The invisible watchdog (`vision_watchdog.vbs` / `vision_watchdog.exe`) monitors
**all 13 process names** and starts/stops the vision MCP server automatically —
no manual steps needed.
